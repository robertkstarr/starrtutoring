        <Paragraph>
          As a private tutor, I'm available to help in all levels of high school
          math and physics including AP Physics and AP Calculus. I also provide
          services in test-taking strategies, including for the SAT.

        <Paragraph>
          Generally speaking, I travel to you. That's typically in your home,
          though I'm flexible â€” many students prefer to meet in a library or
          coffee shop and that's also acceptable.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I'm based out of the Agoura Hills area and generally service anywhere
          within an hour or so of there.

        <Paragraph>
          I've also tutored via teleconferencing and while it'll work in a
          pinch, I've found that it's not ideal.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          My current rate is ${HOURLY_RATE} per hour, though please reach out
          and ask about my sliding scale if that's prohibitively expensive.
